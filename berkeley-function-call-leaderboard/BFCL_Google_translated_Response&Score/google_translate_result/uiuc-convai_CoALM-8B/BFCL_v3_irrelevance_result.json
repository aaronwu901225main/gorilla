Without a steady income, individuals may face financial stress, reduced purchasing power, and a sense of insecurity, which can negatively impact their overall happiness.\n\n3. **Cost of Living**: The cost of living can also affect happiness. A high cost of living can lead to financial stress and reduced purchasing power, which can decrease happiness.\n\n4. **Social Services**: The availability and quality of social services, such as healthcare, education, and social security, can also impact happiness. Better social services can contribute to a higher sense of security and well-being, while poor services can lead to stress and dissatisfaction.\n\n5. **Social Comparison**: Economic conditions can also influence happiness through social comparison.
