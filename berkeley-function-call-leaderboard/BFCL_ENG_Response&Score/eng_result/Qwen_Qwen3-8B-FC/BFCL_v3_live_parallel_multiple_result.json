First, they want to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. So, looking at the tools provided, the ChaFod function is for modifying food items. The parameters needed are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the new food item. They mentioned removing anchovies, so I should set removeIngredients to \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. The specialInstructions might be optional here, but since they didn't specify any, maybe it's not needed. So the first function call would be ChaFod with foodItem \"Caesar salad\" and removeIngredients \"anchovies\".\n\nNext, the drink order. The user wants to update order 123 to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The relevant tool here is ChaDri.change_drink. The parameters required are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. The new_preferences include size \"large\", temperature \"hot\", sweetness_level \"regular\", milk_type \"almond\". The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so that can be omitted. So the second function call would be ChaDri.change_drink with drink_id 123 and new_preferences containing those values.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct parameters for each function. For ChaFod, the foodItem is Caesar salad, and removeIngredients is anchovies. For the drink, the parameters are set according to the user's specifications. I should check if all required parameters are included. Both functions have their required parameters met. Also, enums for the drink's size, temperature, etc., are correctly used. No typos in the parameter names. Alright, that should cover both parts of the user's request."}

The ControlAppliance.execute function is designed for controlling home appliances. The parameters require a command in Korean, specifying the room, appliance, and action. \n\nLooking at the enum examples for the command parameter, the format is \"room, appliance, command\".

So even if it's not in the enum, as long as it follows the format, it should work. \n\nSo I'll create two separate tool calls: one for turning on the AC in the living room and another for stopping the air purifier in the bedroom.

The user is asking for the latest news report for two different locations: Paris, France and Letterkenny, Ireland. They want Paris in English and Letterkenny with a focus on technology news, also in English.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available tools. There's the get_news_report function. The parameters required are location, category, and language. The location should be in 'City, State' format, but since Paris is a city in France, I should format it as 'Paris, France'. Similarly, Letterkenny is in Ireland, so 'Letterkenny, Ireland' makes sense. \n\nFor the first request, Paris, the category isn't specified, so it should default to 'General'. The language is English, which is the default, so that's covered. \n\nFor Letterkenny, the user specifically mentioned technology news. So the category should be 'Technology' and the language remains 'en' as per default. \n\nI need to make two separate function calls. Each call will have the respective location, category, and language. Let me structure each tool_call properly. \n\nWait, the parameters for get_news_report require the location in 'City, State (abbr)' format. Wait, the description says 'City, State (abbr)' but in the example, it's 'San Francisco, CA' which is state abbreviation. However, for countries, it's 'Paris, France'. So for Paris, it's 'Paris, France', and for Letterkenny, since it's in Ireland, the state abbreviation might not apply. The note says if the state isn't available, use 'City, Country'. So Letterkenny, Ireland is correct. \n\nSo the first tool call is get_news_report with location 'Paris, France', category 'General', language 'en'.

Let me check the available tools. There's the get_interviewer_list function which takes a skill parameter. But the user mentioned two skills here: Python and Java. The function's parameters don't allow for multiple skills. Hmm, maybe I need to call the function twice, once for each skill. Wait, the function's description says \"based on a specific skill set,\" but the parameters only have a single skill field. So perhaps the function can handle multiple skills if passed as a list? Wait, looking at the parameters again: the skill is a string, not an array. So the function might not support multiple skills directly. But the user wants both Python and Java. How to handle this?\n\nWait, maybe the user intended to get interviewers skilled in either Python or Java. Since the function can't take multiple skills, maybe I should call the function twice, once for each skill, and then combine the results. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the function's skill parameter can accept multiple skills separated by commas. The description says \"specific skill set,\" which could imply multiple. But the parameter is a string, so maybe it's expecting a single string. However, the example given in the description includes 'Python', 'Data Analysis', or 'System Design' as examples. So perhaps each skill is a single string. \n\nIn this case, the user is asking for Python and Java, so maybe the function can be called twice. But the assistant can only make one tool call per response. Wait, the user's query is to get interviewers for both Python and Java. Since the function can't handle multiple skills in one call, the assistant might need to make two separate calls. However, the user might not be aware of that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept a list of skills. Wait, the parameters for get_interviewer_list have \"skill\" as a string, not an array. So the function is designed for a single skill. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to call the function once for Python and once for Java. But since the assistant can only make one tool call per response, perhaps the user needs to be informed that they need to specify one skill at a time. However, the user might expect both. Alternatively, maybe the function can take multiple skills as a comma-separated string. For example, skill: \"Python, Java\". But the description doesn't specify that. The examples given are single skills. \n\nIn this case, the assistant might need to make two separate calls. But the user's query is a single request. So perhaps the assistant should call the function once for each skill. However, the system might not allow multiple tool calls in one response. Wait, the instructions say \"You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\" So the assistant can make multiple tool calls. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to call get_interviewer_list for Python and then again for Java. But the user might want both. So the assistant should make two tool calls. Let me check the parameters again. The function's parameters include skill (required), experience_level (default Mid-Level), and availability (default true). So for each skill, the assistant can call the function with the respective skill. \n\nTherefore, the assistant should generate two tool calls: one for Python and one for Java. But the user's query is to get interviewers for both. So the answer would involve two separate function calls. However, the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept multiple skills. But given the parameters, it's a single string. \n\nIn conclusion, the assistant should call the function twice, once for each skill. So the tool calls would be:\n\nFirst call: get_interviewer_list with skill \"Python\"\nSecond call: get_interviewer_list with skill \"Java\"\n\nBut the user might need to be informed that the function is called for each skill. However, the user's query is to get a list for both, so the assistant should handle that by making two calls."}

The user wants to clone a repo, analyze it, create Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAMLs, add changes to Git, and then commit and push. \n\nFirst, I need to clone the repository. The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires the repo_url. The destination isn't specified, so it'll default to the current directory. I'll call clone_repo with that URL.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name. Since the repo was cloned into the current directory, I'll use '.' as the directory name. This will determine the main programming language, which is probably Node.js given the repo name.\n\nThen, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs the directory_name. Again, using '.' since the repo is in the current directory. The Dockerfile will be based on the analysis, so if it's Node.js, the Dockerfile should have Node.js as the base image.\n\nAfter that, create Kubernetes YAMLs. The create_kubernetes_yaml_file requires the directory_name, which is again '.', and parameters like deployment_name, image_name, etc. The image name might be based on the repo name, like zelarhq/nodejs-welcome. The deployment name could default to something like 'nodejs-welcome', and the service type might be ClusterIP unless specified otherwise.\n\nOnce the Dockerfile and YAMLs are created, the user wants to add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function will handle that. The directory_name is the same, and the commit message and branch name can use defaults unless specified. The user didn't mention a custom message or branch, so 'Update changes' and 'main' are safe defaults.\n\nWait, but the user said \"add all changed file to git changes\" which might mean adding the new files. The push function automatically adds changes, so that's covered. \n\nI need to make sure each step is called in order. Let me check each function's parameters again to ensure correctness. The clone_repo is straightforward. The analysis will inform the Dockerfile and Kubernetes files. Then pushing the changes. \n\nI think that's all. Let's structure the tool calls accordingly."}

First, the user wants information on significant events, news articles, and developments since October 2021, but specifically only information published after 2022. They also mentioned wanting a digital painting of a masked woman with certain artistic elements.\n\nSo, the first part is about gathering recent news. The user specified to include only info from 2022 onwards. The search_engine.query tool seems perfect here. I need to set include_after_year to true to filter results from 2022. The prompt should be exactly as they wrote: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. Wait, but the include_after_year parameter is for 2022 onwards. Since the user wants info since October 2021 but only published after 2022, maybe the search query should be adjusted to focus on 2022 and later. But the user said to check for the verbatim phrase, so I should use their exact wording. However, the include_after_year flag will ensure the results are from 2022 onwards. That should cover it.\n\nNext, the user wants a digital painting. The generate_image tool can handle that. The description is detailed: masked woman with peacock feathers, cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha style. I need to translate that into a prompt. The resolution and color mode might need to be set. Since it's a digital painting, maybe high resolution and RGB color mode. The image_quality can be set to 90 for better quality. The generate_image function's parameters include resolution, color_mode, and image_quality. Let me structure the prompt to include all those elements: \"a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style.\" That should work. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"digital painting,\" so maybe using generate_image is appropriate. The generate_human_image tool is for human subjects, but the prompt includes specific artistic styles. However, the generate_image tool is more general. The user might want a digital painting, which could be an image generated with artistic elements. So, using generate_image with the detailed prompt makes sense. \n\nI should make two tool calls: one for the search_engine.query with the specified parameters and another for generate_image with the artistic description. Let me double-check the parameters. For the search, include_after_year is true, source is default Google. For the image, resolution default is 1280x720, color_mode RGB, image_quality 80. But the user might want higher quality, so setting image_quality to 90. Also, the prompt needs to be precise. \n\nEverything seems covered. Let me structure the tool calls accordingly."}

The user wants to find out when Shishir's birthday is from previous conversations and then send a congratulatory message.\n\nFirst, I need to check the conversation history for any mentions of Shishir's birthday. The tool 'recall_memory_search' is designed for searching through prior conversation history. So I'll use that with the query \"Shishir birthday\".\n\nOnce I get the date from the search results, I should send a 'Happy Birthday!' message to Shishir. The 'send_message' function can handle that. The recipient would be Shishir's identifier, which I might need to determine from previous data. If it's not specified, maybe use a default, but ideally, the search result would include the contact info.\n\nWait, the user said \"regardless,\" so even if the birthday date isn't found, they still want the message sent. But maybe the birthday date is necessary for the message. However, the user's instruction says to send the message regardless, so perhaps the date isn't needed for the message itself. Maybe the message is just a general congrats. But the initial part is to find the birthday from previous conversations. If the date isn't found, maybe the message is still sent as a general one. \n\nSo first, perform the search. Then, use the found date (if any) to send the message. But the user might just want the message sent regardless of the date. Wait, the user says \"find out when Shishir's birthday is\" and then \"congratulate him by sending a 'Happy Birthday!' message regardless.\" So the message is to be sent regardless of whether the date is found. But maybe the message should include the date. However, the user's instruction says to send the message regardless, so perhaps the message is just \"Happy Birthday!\" without the date. \n\nSo the steps are: 1. Search for Shishir's birthday in memory. 2. Send the message. \n\nBut the user might expect that if the birthday is found, the message is personalized with the date. However, the user's exact wording is to send \"Happy Birthday!\" regardless. So maybe the message is just that. \n\nSo first, use recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir birthday\" to find the date. Then, send the message. \n\nBut the user might not have stored the birthday date in the memory. In that case, the search might not return anything, but the message is still sent. \n\nSo the first tool call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir birthday\". Then, based on the result, send the message. \n\nBut since the user wants the message sent regardless, even if the date isn't found, the send_message function is called. \n\nSo the first step is to search for the birthday information. Then, send the message. \n\nTherefore, the first tool call is to recall_memory_search with the query \"Shishir birthday\"."}

First, they mentioned a compilation error in their Java project where the method 'getNumericValue()' is not found in 'CellResult'. They want to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. Also, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler' to ensure correct overriding.\n\nStarting with the first part: finding classes related to 'CellResult'. The user specified including subdirectories, so I should use the 'get_relevant_classes' function with the search string 'CellResult' and set include_subdirectories to true. That should give them a list of classes that might be related, helping them check if 'CellResult' is correctly referenced or if there's a missing import.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. For this, the 'get_signature' function is appropriate. I'll need to call it twice: once for each method. The parameters will be the class name 'AbstractCellHandler' and the respective method names. This will provide the parameter types and names, ensuring the user's overridden methods match the expected signatures.\n\nWait, the user also mentioned that 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides several methods. The error is about 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is supposed to have this method, but it's missing. The relevant classes might include 'CellResult' itself, or other classes that interact with it, like handlers or result processors. By finding related classes, the user can check if 'getNumericValue' is present or if there's a typo in the method name.\n\nAlso, the user might be using an older version of a library where 'getNumericValue' is not available, or perhaps they need to implement it themselves. The method signatures from 'AbstractCellHandler' will help ensure that their overridden methods are correctly structured, which could prevent other compilation errors.\n\nI should make sure to call the functions correctly. For 'get_relevant_classes', the search string is 'CellResult', case sensitivity is default false, and include_subdirectories is true. Then, two calls to 'get_signature' for each method. The parameters for 'get_signature' require class_name and method_name, with include_private as false by default. Since the user is overriding methods, they likely need the public signatures, so include_private remains false.\n\nPutting it all together, the tool calls will first search for related classes to 'CellResult', then retrieve the method signatures. This should help the user identify missing classes or incorrect method implementations, addressing the compilation error."}

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method called get_weather(String) in the Weather class. They want to know the available methods and properties of the Weather class and the signature of the get_weather method if it exists.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which tools to use. The user mentioned the Weather class, so I should check the available methods and properties. The get_class_info tool seems appropriate here. It retrieves info about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. The parameters required are class_name, include_private (default false), and module_name (optional). Since the user didn't specify a module, I'll leave module_name as default.\n\nNext, the user also wants the signature of the get_weather method. The get_signature tool is designed for that. It requires class_name and method_name. The include_private parameter is optional, defaulting to false. So I'll use get_signature with class_name \"Weather\" and method_name \"get_weather\".\n\nWait, but the user might not know if the method exists. So first, I should check the class info to see if get_weather is present. However, the tools don't have a way to check method existence directly. The get_signature tool might return an error if the method doesn't exist, but the user's question is to provide the signature if it exists. So maybe I should first get the class info to list all methods, then check if get_weather is among them. But the tools don't allow for that. Alternatively, I can call get_signature directly, and if it's not found, the response would indicate that. But the user wants both the available methods and the signature if it exists. So perhaps first get the class info to list all methods, then check the signature. However, the tools are separate. So the correct approach is to first call get_class_info for the Weather class to get all methods and properties. Then, if get_weather is present, call get_signature for that method. But since the user is asking for both, maybe I should make both tool calls. Let me structure the response accordingly.\n\nSo first, call get_class_info with class_name \"Weather\" to get all methods and properties. Then, call get_signature with class_name \"Weather\" and method_name \"get_weather\" to check if the method exists and get its signature. That way, the user gets both the list of available methods and the specific method's signature if it exists."}

First, they want the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48. I remember that HCF is the same as the greatest common divisor (GCD), so I can use the math_gcd function for this. The parameters required are two non-negative integers, a and b. Since 36 is smaller than 48, I should make sure to pass them correctly. Wait, the function's description says a is the first and larger integer. Oh, right, so I need to swap them. So a should be 48 and b 36. That way, the function can compute the GCD properly.\n\nNext part is estimating how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x=5. Steepness relates to the derivative, which measures the slope of the tangent at a point. The user mentioned using the estimate_derivative function. The parameters needed are the function, x, dx, and method. The function here is f(x) = x\u00b2, which I can represent as a lambda function. The x value is 5. The default dx is 0.0001, and the method defaults to central difference, which is more accurate. So I'll set up the function call with these parameters. \n\nWait, I need to make sure the function is passed correctly. In Python, that would be something like lambda x: x**2. Then x is 5. The dx can stay at the default unless specified, but the user didn't mention it, so I'll use the default. The method is central, which is the default, so maybe I can omit it. But to be explicit, maybe include it. \n\nSo first tool call is math_gcd with a=48 and b=36. Then estimate_derivative with function as lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.0001, method='central'. That should give the derivative at x=5, which for x\u00b2 is 2x, so 10. But the numerical method might give a close approximation. \n\nI need to structure the tool calls correctly. Each in separate XML tags. Let me check the parameters again to ensure they match the required JSON structure. For math_gcd, the parameters are a and b as integers. For estimate_derivative, function is a callable, x is a float, dx optional, method optional. So the JSON should have the function as a lambda, but in JSON, how to represent that? Wait, the function is passed as a callable, but in the tool's parameters, it's of type 'any'. So maybe the user expects the function to be represented as a string, but the example might use a lambda. However, in practice, when using such functions in code, you'd pass the actual function. But since this is a tool call, perhaps the function is represented as a string, like \"lambda x: x**2\". But the exact format might depend on the system. Alternatively, maybe the function is passed as a reference. But given the tool's parameters, I'll represent it as a lambda function in the JSON. \n\nSo the first tool call is math_gcd with a=48, b=36. The second is estimate_derivative with function=lambda x: x**2, x=5, dx=0.0001, method='central'. That should cover both parts of the user's query."}

Then, take 36 divided by 12, which leaves no remainder. So the GCD is 12.\n\nNext, they asked for the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The derivative of x\u00b2 is 2x, so at x=5, it should be 10. But they want an estimation using a finite difference method. The central method is more accurate, so I'll use that. With a small dx, like 0.001, the calculation would be [f(5 + dx) - f(5 - dx)] / (2*dx). Plugging in the numbers, ( (5.001\u00b2 - 4.999\u00b2 ) / 0.002 ). Calculating that gives approximately (25.010001 - 24.990001)/0.002 = 20 / 0.002 = 10. So the estimated derivative should be around 10. I need to call both functions in order."}

Wait, the enum for event_type is [\"Music\", \"Theater\"], so I can't specify both. But the user wants either, so maybe I should make two separate calls? Or perhaps the function can handle a single type at a time. Since the user asked for both, maybe I need to check each type individually. However, the tool might not allow multiple types in one call. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the function can accept a list, but according to the parameters, event_type is a string, not a list. So the user's query might require two separate function calls: one for Music and one for Theater. But the user might expect a combined result. However, given the tool's constraints, I can only call it once per event type. \n\nWait, the user's question is phrased as \"music or theater events\", so perhaps they want both. But the function's event_type is a single string. So maybe the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can take multiple event types if the parameter allows, but according to the schema, it's a single string. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to call the function once for each event type. But since the user is asking for both, maybe the assistant should handle that. However, the tool might not support multiple types in one call. So I'll proceed by calling the function once for Music and once for Theater. But the user's query might require combining both results. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for any music or theater events. So maybe the function can accept either type. But the parameters don't allow for multiple types. Therefore, the assistant should make two separate calls. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can take a list, but the schema says it's a string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can call the function once with event_type as \"Music\" and once as \"Theater\", then combine the results. But since the user is asking for both, perhaps the assistant should do that. However, the current setup allows only one function call per response. Wait, the instructions say that for each turn, the assistant can make one or more function calls. So in this case, the assistant can make two tool calls: one for Music and one for Theater. \n\nBut the user's query is a single question. So the assistant should first check for Music events and then for Theater events. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the function can accept both types if the parameter is a list, but according to the schema, it's a string. \n\nWait, looking back at the function definition for Events_3_FindEvents: the event_type parameter has an enum of [\"Music\", \"Theater\"], so it's a single string. Therefore, the assistant can only query for one type at a time. Therefore, to cover both, the assistant needs to make two separate calls. \n\nBut the user's question is asking for both. So the assistant should make two tool calls. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant can make one call for each type. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to call Events_3_FindEvents twice: once with event_type \"Music\" and once with \"Theater\", both in San Diego, CA on 2023-03-01. \n\nBut the user's query is a single question. So the assistant should make both calls. However, the system might require that each turn can have multiple tool calls. Therefore, the assistant should generate two tool calls here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the assistant can combine them into one call by using a different approach, but given the function's parameters, that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to call the Events_3_FindEvents function twice, once for each event type."}

Looking at the tools provided, the Events_3_FindEvents function seems appropriate. The parameters required are event_type and city, with date being optional. The event_type should be \"Music\" as specified, the city is \"New York, NY\", and the date is given as 2023-05-21. So I'll need to call Events_3_FindEvents with these parameters.\n\nNext, the bus itinerary: The user is traveling from Boston, MA to New York on the same date, May 21, 2023, and needs a direct bus for two people. The Buses_3_FindBus function is the right tool here. The required parameters are from_city, to_city, and departure_date. The from_city is Boston, MA; to_city is New York, NY; departure_date is 2023-05-21. Additionally, the user specified two passengers, so num_passengers should be 2, and the category is direct. I'll include those parameters in the function call.\n\nI need to make sure both function calls are correctly formatted with the right parameters. Let me double-check the parameters for each function to ensure they match the required fields and enums.

The parameters required are city and is_unisex. The city is given as Sunnyvale, CA. The user didn't specify if they want a unisex salon, so the default 'dontcare' should be used.

The user is asking for all pending and active mandates for users named Parath and Bhanu. Hmm, I need to figure out which functions to use here.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's user.mandates and partner.mandates. The user.mandates function takes a name and a status, while partner.mandates takes a status and retrieves mandates for the partner. But the user is asking about specific users, Parath and Bhanu, so maybe the user.mandates function is the right one here. \n\nWait, the user.mandates function's description says it's for partners to retrieve their clients' mandates. So if the user is a partner, they can use this function to get their clients' mandates. But the user is asking for mandates of users Parath and Bhanu, which might be their clients. So for each of those names, we need to call user.mandates with status 'pending' and 'active'. \n\nBut the user.mandates function's status parameter has an enum of active, pending, inactive, and defaults to active. However, the user wants both pending and active. The problem is that the function's status parameter is a single value, not a list. So maybe we need to call the function twice for each name, once with status 'active' and once with 'pending'? Or is there a way to get both in one call? The function's parameters don't allow for multiple statuses, so perhaps two separate calls are needed for each user.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the partner.mandates function is intended for partners to get their own mandates, but the user is asking about specific users, not the partner's own mandates. So partner.mandates might not be the right choice here. \n\nSo the plan is: for each user (Parath and Bhanu), call user.mandates with name set to that user and status set to 'pending' and 'active'. But since the function can only take one status at a time, we need to make two separate calls per user. Wait, but the user wants all pending and active mandates. So maybe the user.mandates function can be called once with status 'pending' and once with 'active' for each user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the status parameter can accept multiple values, but according to the tool definition, the status is a string with enum values. So it's not possible. Therefore, for each user, we need to make two calls. \n\nBut the user is asking for both Parath and Bhanu. So for each of them, we need to call user.mandates twice (once for active, once for pending). That would be 2 users * 2 statuses = 4 function calls. \n\nBut the assistant is supposed to call the functions as needed. However, the user might not want to make four separate calls. Wait, but the function's parameters don't allow for multiple statuses. So the correct approach is to call the function twice for each user. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the partner.mandates function can be used if the user is a partner and wants to get all mandates (pending and active) for their clients. But the partner.mandates function's status parameter can be set to 'all' by default, but the user wants to specify pending and active. Wait, the partner.mandates function's status parameter has an enum of active, pending, inactive, and the default is 'all'. So if we set status to 'all', it would return all mandates. But the user wants only pending and active. However, the function's status parameter is a single string, so maybe the 'all' includes all statuses. But the user wants to exclude inactive. So perhaps using partner.mandates with status 'all' would include inactive, which the user doesn't want. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user.mandates function is the right one here. So for each user, call user.mandates with status 'active' and 'pending' separately. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Call user.mandates for name 'parath' with status 'active'.\n2. Call user.mandates for name 'parath' with status 'pending'.\n3. Call user.mandates for name 'bhanu' with status 'active'.\n4. Call user.mandates for name 'bhanu' with status 'pending'.\n\nBut the user might not want to make four separate calls. However, given the function's parameters, that's the only way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the partner.mandates function can be used if the user is a partner and wants to get all mandates (active and pending) for their clients. But the partner.mandates function's status parameter can be set to 'all' to get all mandates, but that would include inactive ones. The user wants to exclude inactive. So that's not ideal. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the user.mandates function for each user with both statuses. \n\nSo the tool calls would be four separate calls as outlined above."}
