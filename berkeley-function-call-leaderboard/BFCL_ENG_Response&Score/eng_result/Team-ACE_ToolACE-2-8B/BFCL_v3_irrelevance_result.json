The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.\n\n3. The game starts with each player drawing seven cards from the deck. The remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.\n\n4. The top card of the draw pile is turned over and placed beside it, face up, to start the discard pile.\n\n5. The player to the left of the dealer goes first, and then play moves clockwise.\n\n6. Each player's turn consists of two parts: Draw and Discard.\n\n7. During the Draw phase, the player draws the top card from the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile.\n\n8. During the Discard phase, the player discards one card from their hand face up on top of the discard pile.\n\n9. Certain cards have special actions:\n   - Wild: Can be played on any color and allows the player to change the color of play.\n   - Reverse: Reverses the direction of play.\n   - Skip: Skips the next player's turn.\n   - Take Two: Forces the next player to draw two cards and skip their turn.\n   - Wild Draw Four: Allows the player to change the color of play and forces the next player to draw four cards and skip their turn.\n\n10. If a player has only one card left in their hand, they must say \"Uno\" to alert the other players. If they fail to do so and are caught with only one card left, they must draw two cards as a penalty.\n\n11. The game ends when one player has played all their cards.
