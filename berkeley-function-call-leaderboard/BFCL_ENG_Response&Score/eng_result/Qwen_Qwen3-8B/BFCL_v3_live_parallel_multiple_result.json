First, the user wants to change their food order to a Caesar salad without anchovies. Looking at the available functions, there's ChaFod which modifies food items. The parameters required are foodItem, newIngredients, removeIngredients, and specialInstructions. The user specified \"Caesar salad\" as the new food item. They mentioned removing anchovies, so removeIngredients should be \"anchovies\". There's no mention of adding new ingredients, so newIngredients can be left as default. Special instructions might be optional here, but since they didn't specify any, maybe we can omit that or set it to default.\n\nNext, the drink order. The user refers to order 123 and wants it updated to a large hot coffee with regular sweetness and almond milk. The ChaDri.change_drink function is needed here. The required parameters are drink_id and new_preferences. The drink_id is 123. For new_preferences, the size is \"large\", temperature is \"hot\", sweetness_level is \"regular\", and milk_type is \"almond\". The special_instructions aren't mentioned, so we can leave that as default. \n\nWait, the drink function's new_preferences is a dict. So I need to structure that properly. Also, check if all required parameters are present. For ChaFod, foodItem is required, which is provided. For ChaDri, drink_id is 123, and new_preferences includes size, temperature, sweetness_level, and milk_type. \n\nSo, two function calls are needed: one for the food and one for the drink. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parameters. The user didn't mention any special instructions for the drink, so special_instructions can be omitted or set to default. Similarly, for the food, no new ingredients are added, so newIngredients is empty. \n\nI think that's all. Let me format the function calls accordingly."}

Its description says it's for controlling home appliances with commands in Korean, specifying room, appliance, and action. The parameters require a 'command' string in the format \"room, appliance, action\".\n\nThe user's command has two parts: living room AC on and bedroom air purifier off.

Both parts of the user's request fit this structure. \n\nNo other functions seem relevant here.

The result_format can default to text, language to EN, and max_results to 10 unless specified otherwise. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"up-to-date information,\" so maybe HNA_WQA is better than HNA_NEWS since it's for current events. The HNA_NEWS might have news articles, but the WQA is for general web searches. So using HNA_WQA with the keyword 'Imjin War' makes sense.\n\nCheck if all parameters are covered.

The URL given is git@github.com:zelarhq/nodejs-welcome.git. The clone_repo function requires repo_url and optionally destination. Since no destination is specified, I'll use the default '.'.\n\nNext, analyze the repo contents. The analyse_repo_contents function needs the directory_name.

Wait, the repo is cloned to the current directory, so maybe the directory_name is just the repo's name, but the function expects a path relative to the root. Assuming the clone is in the current working directory, directory_name would be '.'.\n\nOnce analyzed, create a Dockerfile. The create_a_docker_file function needs directory_name. Again, using the same directory as the repo. Then, create Kubernetes YAMLs with create_kubernetes_yaml_file. The parameters here might need defaults unless specified. The user didn't mention specific deployment names or image names, so use defaults.\n\nAfter creating the files, add all changes to Git. The push_git_changes_to_github function requires directory_name, commit_message, and branch_name. The default commit message is 'Update changes', and branch is 'main'. The user might want a custom message, but since it's not specified, default is okay.\n\nWait, step 3 says \"add all changed file to git changes\". The push function automatically git adds changes, so after creating the files, call push with the directory, commit message, and branch. \n\nSo the order is: clone, analyze, create Dockerfile, create Kubernetes YAMLs, push. Each step depends on the previous. Let me check if all parameters are provided. The repo URL is given. The directory names are assumed to be the cloned repo's directory. The analysis will determine the language, which might affect the Dockerfile, but the function doesn't take that into account.

The prompt should be exactly what they provided: 'significant events, news articles, and developments that since October 2021'. The source can default to Google unless specified otherwise, which it isn't here.\n\nNext, the user wants a digital painting. The generate_image function seems suitable. The prompt here is the detailed description they gave: \"a digital painting of a masked woman with bright peacock feathers, complex and elegant, with green highlighted lines and complex patterns, reminiscent of cyberpunk Alphonse Mucha's style.\" I should use that as the prompt. For resolution, maybe default is okay unless they specified, but they didn't. Color mode could be RGB as default, and image quality 80. But wait, the generate_human_image function is more specific for humans. However, the user's image is a masked woman, which might be considered a human image. But the generate_image is more general. The generate_human_image has parameters like image_quality as a string (low, medium, high), but the user might want higher quality. However, the generate_image allows image_quality as an integer up to 100. Since the user's request is for a digital painting, maybe generate_image is better. But the generate_human_image is tailored for humans. The prompt mentions a masked woman, so maybe generate_human_image is appropriate. However, the parameters for generate_human_image include image_quality as a string, and the user might want higher quality. But the user's instruction says \"Include only information published after the year 2022\" for the first part, but for the image, there's no such restriction. So, using generate_image with the given prompt, and set resolution to something higher if needed. The user didn't specify resolution, so default is 1280x720. Color mode RGB is default. Image quality 80. Alternatively, maybe the generate_human_image could be used with the same prompt, but the parameters for image_quality are different.

The user wants to find out when Shishir's birthday is from previous conversations and then send a congratulatory message.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's a function to search through conversation history. Looking at the functions provided, there's 'recall_memory_search' which searches prior conversation history. The parameters required are 'query', 'page', and 'request_heartbeat'. The 'query' should be the string to search for, which in this case would be \"Shishir's birthday\".\n\nSo, I'll call recall_memory_search with query=\"Shishir's birthday\" to find the relevant information. The page is defaulting to 0, which is the first page. If the search returns the date, then the next step is to send a message. \n\nAssuming the search finds the birthday date, the next function would be 'send_message' to congratulate Shishir. The parameters needed are 'message' and 'recipient'. The message is \"Happy Birthday!\", and the recipient should be Shishir's identifier. However, the user didn't specify the recipient's details, so maybe the default is used, but ideally, we should have the recipient's email or username. Since the user hasn't provided that, maybe the function has a default, but the parameters require it. Wait, looking back, the 'send_message' function has a default recipient of 'default@example.com'. But if Shishir's contact info is stored in memory, maybe we need to retrieve that first. However, the user hasn't mentioned that, so perhaps we proceed with the default, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the 'recall_memory_search' would also find the recipient details. But the user's question only mentions finding the birthday. \n\nWait, the user says \"regardless\", so maybe the recipient is known. But since the functions don't have a way to get the recipient's info unless stored in memory, and the user hasn't provided it, perhaps the default is used. However, that might not be accurate. But given the functions available, perhaps the user expects to use the default. Alternatively, maybe the 'core_memory_search' or another function could retrieve the recipient's details. But the user hasn't mentioned that, so maybe we proceed with the default. \n\nSo, first, search for the birthday using recall_memory_search. If the result includes the date, then send the message. But the user's question is to send the message regardless of the found date, so maybe the search is just to confirm the date exists, and then send the message. However, the user's instruction is to \"find out when Shishir's birthday is\" and then send the message. So the steps are: search for the birthday date, then send the message. \n\nBut the functions don't have a way to retrieve the date directly; the search would return paginated results. So the first step is to call recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". If that returns the date, then use that information to send the message. However, the user's instruction says to send the message regardless, implying that even if the birthday isn't found, send it. But the user wants to find it first. \n\nBut the functions don't have a way to store the birthday date, so perhaps the search is just to check if it exists. However, the user's question is to send the message after finding the birthday. So the steps are: search for the birthday, then send the message. \n\nBut since the user hasn't provided the recipient's details, maybe the send_message function uses the default. However, the user might expect the message to go to Shishir, so perhaps the recipient is known. But without that info, the function's default is used. \n\nSo the first function call is recall_memory_search with query \"Shishir's birthday\". Then, if the result is found, send the message. But the user's instruction says to send the message regardless, so maybe the search is just to confirm, and then send. However, the user might not have provided the recipient's details, so the send_message function's default is used. \n\nTherefore, the steps are: \n\n1. Use recall_memory_search to find Shishir's birthday in conversation history.\n2. Use send_message to send \"Happy Birthday!\" to the recipient (using default if not specified).\n\nBut the user's question says \"regardless\", so maybe the message is sent even if the birthday isn't found. However, the user wants to find it first. \n\nSo the answer would be to first search for the birthday, then send the message. But since the user hasn't provided the recipient's details, the send_message function's default is used. \n\nThus, the function calls would be:\n\n[recall_memory_search(query=\"Shishir's birthday\"), send_message(message=\"Happy Birthday!\", recipient=\"default@example.com\")]"}

The user is facing a compilation error in their Java project. The class 'StringNumberHandler' extends 'AbstractCellHandler' and overrides methods like 'getCellValue', 'setCellValue', 'getExcelType', and 'getDefaultExcelFormat'. The error is about the method 'getNumericValue()' not being found in 'CellResult'.\n\nFirst, the user wants to find relevant classes related to 'CellResult' including subdirectories. The function 'get_relevant_classes' seems appropriate here. The parameter 'search_string' should be 'CellResult', and 'include_subdirectories' should be set to True to ensure all subdirectories are checked.\n\nNext, they need the method signatures for 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' in 'AbstractCellHandler'. The 'get_signature' function can retrieve method signatures. They'll need to call this function twice: once for each method. The parameters will be 'class_name' as 'AbstractCellHandler' and 'method_name' as 'setCellValue' and 'getCellValue' respectively. Since the user is overriding these methods, checking if they are private might be important, but the default for 'include_private' is False, so maybe that's okay unless the methods are private. But the user hasn't mentioned private methods, so sticking with defaults makes sense.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that 'getNumericValue()' is missing in 'CellResult'. Maybe 'CellResult' is part of a library or another class they're using. The first step is to find classes related to 'CellResult' to see if there's a class that has 'getNumericValue' or related methods. So using 'get_relevant_classes' with 'CellResult' and include subdirectories would help identify possible classes.\n\nThen, checking the 'AbstractCellHandler' class's methods to ensure the overridden methods have the correct signatures. So two calls to 'get_signature' for each method.\n\nI should make sure all required parameters are provided. For 'get_relevant_classes', 'search_string' is required. For 'get_signature', both 'class_name' and 'method_name' are required. The user hasn't provided module names, so defaults will be used where applicable. Since the user is working in Java, but the functions are for Python, but the parameters like 'language' in 'get_imports' aren't needed here.

The user is facing a compilation error because there's no suitable method called get_weather(String) in the Weather class.

The available functions are get_class_info, get_signature, get_relevant_classes, and get_imports. \n\nThe user is asking for two things: the available methods/properties of the Weather class and the signature of get_weather if it exists. \n\nFor the first part, get_class_info seems appropriate. This function retrieves information about a class's methods, properties, and constructor. The parameters needed are class_name and optionally module_name. Since the user didn't specify a module, I'll assume the Weather class is in the current module. So, I'll call get_class_info with class_name='Weather'.\n\nNext, the user wants the signature of the get_weather method. The get_signature function is designed for that. It requires class_name and method_name. The class is Weather, and the method is get_weather. So, I'll call get_signature with those parameters. However, I should check if the method exists. If it doesn't, this function might not return anything, but the user still wants to know if it exists. \n\nWait, the user mentioned the compilation failure, so the method might not exist. But the user is asking to provide the signature if it exists. So, even if it's not there, the function will return nothing, but the user will know. \n\nSo, the two function calls needed are get_class_info for the Weather class and get_signature for the get_weather method. \n\nI need to make sure all required parameters are provided. For get_class_info, class_name is required. For get_signature, both class_name and method_name are required.

The user is asking two things: first, to find the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48, and second, to determine how steep the curve of the function f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x = 5. \n\nStarting with the first part, the HCF of two numbers is the same as their greatest common divisor (GCD). Looking at the available functions, there's a math_gcd function that takes two integers, a and b. The parameters require both numbers, which the user has provided: 36 and 48. So, I can call math_gcd with a=36 and b=48. Wait, but the description mentions that 'a' should be the larger integer. Since 48 is larger than 36, maybe I should swap them? Or does the function handle that internally? The function's parameters don't specify that a must be larger, just that it's the first and larger non-negative integer. Hmm, but the user provided 36 and 48. To comply with the function's parameter description, perhaps I should set a=48 and b=36. However, the function might not require a to be larger, but the description says \"the first and larger non-negative integer\". Wait, maybe that's a mistake in the description. Because GCD is commutative, the order shouldn't matter. But to be safe, maybe the function expects a to be larger. Let me check the parameters again. The parameters for math_gcd are a and b, both integers, required. The description says \"the first and larger non-negative integer for which to calculate the GCD.\" So a should be the larger one. Therefore, I should pass a=48 and b=36. But the user provided 36 and 48. So maybe the function can handle it regardless, but according to the description, a must be the larger. So I need to make sure that a is larger. Therefore, the correct parameters would be a=48, b=36. But the user might have given them in any order. However, the function's parameters require a to be the larger. So I need to adjust that. Wait, but the user's question says \"highest common factor for 36 and 48\", so the order doesn't matter. But the function's parameter description says a is the first and larger. So perhaps the function expects a to be larger. Therefore, I should pass a=48 and b=36. But the user might not have specified which is larger. However, the function's parameters might not enforce that, but the description says so. So to comply with the function's parameters, I should pass a=48 and b=36. Alternatively, maybe the function can handle any order. But since the description says a is the first and larger, perhaps the function expects that. So I'll proceed with a=48 and b=36.\n\nNow, the second part: determining how steep the curve of f(x) = x\u00b2 is at x=5. The steepness of a curve at a point is given by the derivative of the function at that point. The user is asking for the derivative of f(x) = x\u00b2 at x=5. The available function is estimate_derivative, which takes the function, x, dx, and method. The function is provided as a callable object. In Python, to pass a function, we can use a lambda or a defined function. Since the user is using Python 3 syntax, I can represent the function as a lambda: lambda x: x**2. Then, the x value is 5. The dx has a default of 0.0001, and the method defaults to 'central'. So the parameters would be function=lambda x: x**2, x=5. The dx and method can be omitted since they have defaults. Therefore, the call would be estimate_derivative(function=lambda x: x**2, x=5).\n\nPutting it all together, the two function calls needed are math_gcd with a=48 and b=36, and estimate_derivative with the function and x=5."}

The user specified 'Europe/Berlin' for the timezone, so I'll set that. They also want the date included, so include_date should be True.

All required parameters are provided. So, I'll call that function with those details.\n\nI need to make sure the date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD) and time in 24-hour format. The user's input matches these. No issues there. The weather function isn't needed here. So, two function calls are necessary."}

The user is asking for the current weather in Boston, MA and San Francisco, using Fahrenheit. First, I need to check the available functions. There's get_current_weather which takes location and unit. The parameters are location (required) and unit (optional, default Fahrenheit). So for Boston, MA, I can call get_current_weather with location=\"Boston, MA\". For San Francisco, the user specified \"in fahr\", so I should set unit=\"fahrenheit\" there. Wait, the function's unit parameter uses 'fahrenheit' as the enum value. So I need to make two separate calls: one for Boston and another for San Francisco with the unit specified. Let me make sure I have both locations correct. The user mentioned both cities, so two function calls are needed. No other parameters are missing since location is required and unit is optional but specified for San Francisco. Alright, that should cover it."}
{"id": "live_parallel_multiple_23-20-0", "result": "[user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"active\"), user.mandates(name=\"parath\", status=\"pending\"), user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"active\"), user.mandates(name=\"bhanu\", status=\"pending\")]", "input_token_count": 2204, "output_token_count": 450, "latency": 162.37727093696594, "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants all pending and active mandates for users named Parath and Bhanu.\n\nFirst, I need to check the available functions. There's 'user.mandates' and 'partner.mandates'. The 'user.mandates' function requires a 'name' parameter, which is the user's full name, and a 'status' which can be active, pending, or inactive. The default status is active. Since the user wants both pending and active, I need to call this function twice for each user, once with status 'active' and once with 'pending'.\n\nWait, but the 'status' parameter in 'user.mandates' is a single string, not a list. So for each user, I can't specify multiple statuses in one call. Therefore, for each user (Parath and Bhanu), I need two separate calls: one with status 'active' and another with 'pending'. That's four calls in total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'partner.mandates' function could be used, but that's for the partner's own mandates, not specific users. The description says it's for the partner's mandates, so if the user is asking about their clients, then 'user.mandates' is the right choice. \n\nSo, for each name (Parath and Bhanu), make two calls. Let me structure that. \n\nFirst call: user.mandates(name='Parath', status='active')\nSecond call: user.mandates(name='Parath', status='pending')\nThird call: user.mandates(name='Bhanu', status='active')\nFourth call: user.mandates(name='Bhanu', status='pending')\n\nThat should cover all pending and active mandates for both users. I don't see any other functions that can handle this. The parameters are all provided, so no missing info here."}
