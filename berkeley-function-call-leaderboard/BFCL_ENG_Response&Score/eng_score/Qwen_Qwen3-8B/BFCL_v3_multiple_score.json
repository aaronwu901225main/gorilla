Let me check the functions provided.\n\nLooking at the sculpture.create_custom function, the material parameter has an enum with options: Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, Stone. So the available materials are those five. The user specified bronze, which is one of the options. \n\nWait, the question is about material options available. The function's parameters for material include Bronze as an option. So the answer should list the enum values. But the user is asking for the options, not to place an order yet. However, the functions provided don't have one that lists available materials. The sculpture.create_custom function's material parameter has the enum, but there's no function to retrieve the list of materials. \n\nBut the user is asking for the material options available. Since the function's parameters include the enum, maybe the answer is that the available materials are the ones listed in the enum. However, the user might be expecting to see those options. But according to the functions given, there's no function to get the list. So maybe the assistant should respond with the enum values from the sculpture.create_custom function's material parameter. But the user's question is about the available options, so the answer is the enum values. However, the user might not need to call a function for that. Wait, the user is asking for the material options available, which are listed in the function's parameters. But the functions provided don't have a function that returns the available materials. So the assistant can't call a function to get that info. Therefore, the answer should be that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. But the user's question is phrased as a request to order, but they are asking about options. However, the user might be trying to place an order but needs to know the options. But the functions don't have a way to list materials. So the assistant should inform the user of the available materials based on the function's enum. However, the user's question is about the options, so the answer is the enum values. But the user might not need to call a function for that. Wait, the user is asking for the material options available. Since the function's parameters include the enum, the assistant can list those as the available options. But the user's question is not a function call, but the assistant is supposed to use the functions provided. However, there's no function that retrieves the available materials. Therefore, the assistant can't call a function to get that info. So the answer would be that the available materials are the ones listed in the enum. But the user's question is about the options, so the assistant should answer that. However, the user's initial message is asking for the material options, so the assistant should provide that info without a function call. But according to the instructions, if the question lacks parameters required by the function, point it out. But in this case, the user is asking for options, not to create an order. So the assistant should answer that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone. However, the user might be trying to order, but the question is about the options. Therefore, the assistant should answer based on the function's parameters. But the user's question is not a function call, so the assistant should answer directly. However, the instructions say that the assistant should only return function calls if needed. Since the user is asking for material options, which are part of the function's parameters, but there's no function to retrieve that info, the assistant can't call a function. Therefore, the answer is that the available materials are the ones listed in the enum. But the user's question is not a function call, so the assistant should answer directly. However, the user's question is phrased as a request to order, but they are asking about options. So the assistant should answer that the available materials are Bronze, Marble, Terracotta, Wood, and Stone.
