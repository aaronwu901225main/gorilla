But the second house's rooms are not mentioned. Wait, the user might have intended that the second house has the same number of rooms as the first, but that's an assumption.

However, the user's question is in the context of the first house's parameters.

The original first house had 3 rooms. The second house is similar, but the user didn't mention rooms. So maybe the second house has the same number of rooms as the first? But the user didn't specify. However, the function requires rooms as a parameter. So if the user didn't provide it, I need to check if it's required. The function's required parameters include rooms. Therefore, for the second house, the user hasn't provided the rooms parameter. So I need to point that out. Wait, but the user says \"similar house\" which might imply that the rooms are same as the first. But since the user didn't explicitly state it, maybe I should assume that the rooms are same? Or is that an assumption I can't make? The problem is that the user's question might have a missing parameter for the second house. However, the user might have intended that the second house has the same number of rooms as the first. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should mention that the rooms parameter is missing for the second house. But the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, I should point it out. However, the user's question is in the context of the first house's parameters. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question: \"predict the price of a house with an area of 2500 square feet, 3 rooms, constructed in the year 2000, and located in New York, and then compare it with the price of a similar house but with an area of 3000 square feet, constructed in the year 2005, and located in Los Angeles?\"\n\nThe second house is similar, but the user didn't mention rooms. So the rooms parameter is missing. Therefore, I need to point out that the second house's rooms parameter is missing. However, the user might have intended that the second house has the same number of rooms as the first. But since the user didn't specify, I can't assume. Therefore, the second house's parameters are missing rooms. So I need to mention that. But the user's instruction says that if the parameters are missing, I should point it out.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and the second house's rooms are same as the first. But I can't assume that. Therefore, the second house's parameters are missing rooms.
